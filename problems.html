											<h3>Impact</h3>
											<p>
												The stress levels generated from the organization due to overload affect the work-life balance severely. Our stress affects our behavior altogether, and we take this into our personal life, leading to damaged personal relationships from friends to family. “When the organization helps to reduce the interference from the work through WLB (Work-Life Balance) practices, the demands of family are met much better and it is evident to reduce the disruption of work” (Sharma and Jha 100).

											<h3>Burnout</h3>
											<p>
												The problem begins to affect your personal life, causing personal relationships to suffer, and your mental energy tends to take a toll. The dissatisfaction created by constantly feeling pressured with no means for leisure and support will become stressful and cause the employee to face burnout. In a survey with 504 developers involved, “82% of all developers indicated that they have experienced burnout … Developers indicated increased workload and poor work culture as the main reason” (Mansoor 2021).

										<h3>Complications</h3>
										<p>
											Work-Life Balance isn't all in effect at the workplace only. "The problem according to the Spillover Theory suggests our experiences in one role affect the experiences in the other, rendering the role alike" (Gyanchandani 55). Likewise, this includes our mood, values, and behaviors from one role to the next.
										</p>
										<p>
											Workers need to feel the influence of reciprocity from the organization. Exchange underlies positive effects on attitude towards the company. Feeling as if the organization cares causes an employee to feel more obligation to the organization, creating positive outcomes for both sides.
										</p>
										<h3>Identifying the Problem</h3>
										<p>
											Stress is the main product of imbalance, causing us not to be as productive as we could be. Many employees end up doing lots of overtime, creating high absenteeism and staff turnover rates. It is essential to pay attention to the presented problems and act early on them.
										</p>

										<p>It is important to notice when:</p>
										<ul>

										<ul>
										<ul>
											<li>You are working all the time</li>
											<li>You aren't getting consistent sleep</li>
											<li>You are losing amusement outside of work</li>
											<li>You aren't finishing projects; you are procrastinating</li>
											<li>You are constantly stressed</li>
											<li>You never take time to yourself</li>
										</ul>
