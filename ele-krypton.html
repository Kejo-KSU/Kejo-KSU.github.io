								<p>Krypton is a noble gas element that was discovered in 1898 by Sir William Ramsay and Morris Travers. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas that is found in trace amounts in the Earth's atmosphere. Krypton is one of the six noble gases and is located in the periodic table between argon and xenon. It has the atomic number 36 and the symbol Kr. Krypton is a non-reactive element and is used in certain lighting applications, such as fluorescent bulbs and photographic flashes. It is also used in some types of laser technology.</p>
								<p>Krypton, related to the noble gas of Superman's home planet, is a fascinating element known for its unique properties and role in scientific research. While it may not have the same explosive qualities as its comic book namesake, krypton plays an important role in fields such as lighting, lasers, and high-speed photography. With its distinctive spectral lines and bright colors, krypton also serves as an excellent tool for scientific analysis and experimentation, making it a favorite among chemists and physicists alike.</p>
								<p>Krypton has no significant past uses in history due to its rarity and lack of reactivity with other elements. Krypton's primary use today is in lighting, where it is used in fluorescent lamps and other lighting sources.</p>
