										<h3>The Worker and The Company</h3>
										<p>
											It is best to be a part of a supportive workplace that values and trusts the staff. Remember that finding such a balance shouldn't be something you have to do yourself. There is no one size fits all solution to the problem presented. Some people may prefer a four-day workweek; others might prefer the ability to work from home. There also might be people who like counseling services or free gym memberships, but companies must find out their needs! "The higher degree of job satisfaction is essential because it will translate to a greater level of productivity and, consequently, profitability" (McKellop 2016).
										</p>
										<p>
											The road to a healthy work-life balance is not a self-journey. The company should be there to help out in every way possible. "Not enough organizations are making the link that actually when they have a family-friendly workplace their employees are more productive, more engaged, more motivated and that the absenteeism rates reduce, and that they are much more successful at recruiting and retaining staff" (BBC 2016). Just for a few examples, organizations should:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>Ask workers about their work-life balance needs.</li>
											<li>Watch employee stress levels and mental health, which could lead to burnout.</li>
											<li>Understand that longer hours won't always increase productivity, as overstressed employees negatively impact business!</li>
											<li>Spend time working smarter and not harder.</li>
											<li>Foster healthy communication between company and employee.</li>
											<li>Promote fun and creativity in the workplace.</li>
										</ul>

										<h3>The Study</h3>
										<p>
											Studies show when companies work to promote good work-life balance, the whole organization enjoys the benefits. Employees that feel better are more productive, causing retention to improve and absenteeism to descend. It is also essential that the employee cares for themselves, giving them time to relax and develop a support system.
										</p>
										<p>
											"Study suggested only 12% feel their work-life balance is 'just right.' Less than a quarter (22%) think they have 'the right balance of time and money for their family to thrive'" (BBC 2016). It will not just be more vacation time, but rather control and regulation in their working lives. Employees that could work wherever not only hit all their goals but were much more ecstatic than those working under a paradigm (McKellop 2016). Such a degree of job satisfaction translates to higher productivity, meaning greater profitability.
										</p>

										<p>
											It is critical to give clear directions about the company's goals and make sure each employee or team member is on the same page.

											<h3>Demands</h3>
											<p>
												People consistently seek good quality of life, good health, affordable childcare, further education, more money, time to travel, time with friends and family, and time to do sports, hobbies, and other work. Qualified psychiatrist Emma Sedgwick states, “You don’t suddenly tick a box saying now I’ve got my work-life balance right—it’s something you have to continually revisit” (Oxtoby 5).

											<h3>Additional Solutions</h3>
											<p>
												While there are many ways to reach a contemporary solution, a few additional tips would include:
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Managing your time correctly. Give yourself time to complete your work!</li>
												<li>As chronic stress can build from work, find ways to detach from working.</li>
												<li>Voice your concerns and learn how to say "No!"</li>
												<li>Consider the options available to control your stress.</li>
											</ul>
